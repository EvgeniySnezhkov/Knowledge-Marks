## Links

- Backlinks: Only add external links if you got a backlink to your site.
- Internal links: Add ~3 internal links to your content.
- [Languages](https://moz.com/learn/seo/hreflang-tag) - The hreflang tag tells Google which language you are using on a specific page, so the search engine can serve that result to users searching in that language
  `<link rel="alternate" href="example.com/fr/" hreflang="fr-fr" />`.
- Naming: Use a descriptive link name: “Click here” or “Read more” are bad link text. Better “Read more about SEO and Web Accessibility”.
- [nofollow](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/96569) - Add `rel="nofollow"` attribute to external links only to prevent spam and bad links.
- Title: add the title attribute to links.
